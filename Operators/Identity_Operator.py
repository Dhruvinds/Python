# Identity Operators

#1. IS 

# a = 10
# b = 10
# c = 20
# print(id(a))
# print(id(b))
# print(a is b) if both id are same then TRUE
# print(a is c) if both id are not same then False

#2. IS NOT

# a = 10
# b = 10
# c = 20
# d = '10'

# print(id(a))
# print(id(b))
# print(id(c))
# print(id(d))

# print(a is not b) If both id are same than False
# print(a is not c) If both id are not same than True
