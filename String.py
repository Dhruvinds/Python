# Variable and gives direct value to the string that means it works like literals

# s1 = 'Hello'
# s2 = "Hello"
# # s3 = 'John's'
# s3 = "John's"
# s4 = '''Hello
#         How Are You'''

# for x in s4 :
#     print(x)

# print(s2[1])
# print(s2[-1])
# print(s4)

# Operators on String
#1. Concatenation 2. Repetition 3. Indexing 4.Slicing 5. in 6. Not in

# 1. Concatenation
# s1 = "Hello"
# s2 = "World"

# s3 = s1 + " " + s2
# print(s3)

# s1 = "How " + "Are " + "You"
# print(s1)

# s1 = "Hello" + str(15)
# print(s1)

# 2. Repetition

# s1 = "Dhruvin"
# s2 = s1 * 4
# print(s2)

# 3. Indexing
# Sequence or array of character
# s1 = "Hello World"
# for x in s1 :
#     print(x)

# Range based indexing
# s2 = "How Are You!"
# for i in range(0, len(s2)) :
#     print(s2[i])

# Reverse String Printing

# s1 = "Hello World"
# print(len(s1))

# for i in range(len(s1)-1, -1, -1) :
#     print(s1[i])

# Printing of skipping 1 number

# for i in range(0, len(s1), 2) :
#     print(s1[i])

# 4. Slicing
#string[start:end:step] optional

# s1 = "Hello World"

# print(s1[0:12:1])
# print(s1[::1])
# print(s1[0:len(s1):1])
# print(s1[-1:-len(s1)-1:-1])

#5 IN
# s1 = "Dhruvin Sorathiya"
# s2 = "D" in s1
# print(s2)

#6 NOT IN
# s3 = "H" not in s1
# print(s3)
